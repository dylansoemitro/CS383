This assignment took me around 1 hour total.
I learnt about the CMU dictionary, and how to use it to see if words rhyme, and subsequently checked validity of limericks.
A potential scenario where it would be useful to be able to identify if a poem was a limerick or not is if one was investigating the different forms of poetry occuring over time. We would see if 
the percentage of poetry created varied during notable events, such as wars, so it would be useful to have a script that would identify types of poems, limericks being one of them.
