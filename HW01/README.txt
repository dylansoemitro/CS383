I spent around 6-7 hours total on the assignment.
I learnt how to train a language model, and use it to evaluate a corpus and random sentences. 
Language models would be useful in a task where we would discern the differences in different writers. A language model would be trained on each individual writers work, and then if they had an anonymous piece of work, we could use the langauge models to identify who wrote it.

I rewrote the lm.py file so that it tested all the sentences from the treebank corpus. From there, I observed the sentences with the lowest perplexities. Some such sentences are below: '"* To avoid these costs, and a possible default, immediate action is imperative."': 119.11957376082466, '* Kill it," he says *T*-1.': 118.91688207151385, 'Younkers rang up sales *ICH*-1 in 1988 of $313 million *U*.': 118.43273194524652, 'Volume was 372.9 million shares, up from 334.5 million on Tuesday.': 118.31520269425192, '"If you could get the rhythm of the program trading, you could take advantage of it."': 117.37538318696976, 'Primerica closed at $28.25 *U*, down 50 cents.': 117.32770825709063, 'The company acknowledges some problems.': 117.03067456561955, 'All came from Cray Research.': 116.60359680463223, 'You will not panic,': 116.32003185296195, 'She was untrained and, in one botched job killed a client.': 116.28452015630597, 'She had gone so far as *-1 to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers.': 116.08625101975244, "Officials of Triton couldn't be reached *-157 for comment.": 115.74376108809517, 'In June 1988, I wrote in this space about this issue.': 115.18876852954571, "But he blames program trading for only some of the market's volatility.": 115.16314769184434, 'And I apparently had no right * to print hither what the Voice was booming *T*-2 to yon.': 114.99935097660195, 'At the same time, the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed *-1 to revive the residential construction industry.': 114.90463811771455, 'But "because it\'s all 0 we\'ve got *T*-1, I\'m going *-2 to vote for it."': 113.82930991636357, "Billings *ICH*-3 weren't disclosed *-1 for the small account, which *T*-155 had been serviced *-2 at Young & Rubicam, New York.": 113.76411955818448, '"If I were choosing the people of tomorrow, I would have chosen the people who *T*-1 are now on the board," he said *T*-2.': 113.57867778933547, '"There is finally some sort of sense in the market," she says *T*-1.': 112.8918393925507, 'For the year ended Sept. 30, Ralston earned $422.5 million *U*, or $6.44 *U* a share, up 8.9% from $387.8 million *U*, or $5.63 *U* a share.': 112.76914046530962, 'He will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $244,000 *U* with certain other fringe benefits.': 112.76001087792406, 'Behind all the hoopla is *T*-1 some heavy-duty competition.': 112.71543151035095, "They didn't have much luck during the Reagan administration.": 112.61837037556778, '"We had *-1 to do something structurally and radically different."': 112.61317338911056, 'The Herald joins the Baltimore News-American, which *T*-46 folded, and the Boston Herald-American, which *T*-1 was sold *-62, as cornerstones of the old Hearst newspaper empire abandoned * by the company in the 1980s.': 112.38276924779501, '"She said something like ` You just want *-1 to make it easy for the school . \'': 112.33926072115342, 'Svenska Intecknings Garanti Aktiebolaget -LRB- Sweden -RRB- --': 112.06058583350956, "The Supreme Court's decision in INS v.
